/**
Question: Smallest Substring of All Characters
Given an array of unique characters arr and a string str, Implement a function getShortestUniqueSubstring that finds the smallest substring of str containing all the characters in arr. Return "" (empty string) if such a substring doesn’t exist.

Come up with an asymptotically optimal solution and analyze the time and space complexities.


Example:
input:  arr = ['x','y','z'], str = "xyyzyzyx"
output: "zyx"


Constraints:
[time limit] 5000ms
[input] array.character arr
1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 30
[input] string str
1 ≤ str.length ≤ 500
[output] string

/**
Hints: Smallest Substring of All Characters
If your peer is stuck, ask how they can determine if a given substring is valid and then ask how to apply that in their solution. Recall that a substring is considered valid if it contains all the characters in the input array, arr.
If your peer is using a brute force approach by checking all the possible substrings, ask how they can avoid duplicate computations.
Make sure proper initializations are made.
Watch out for unnecessary variables and steps.
For other solutions, make sure that any permutation of the characters in the input array arr can be found by the algorithm your peer proposes.
If still no progress, point your peer in the right direction by hinting them to use two indices (the start and end positions of a sliding window) in order to efficiently traverse the array and check potential substrings.

/**
Answer: Smallest Substring of All Characters

We scan the input string str from left to right while maintaining two indices - headIndex and tailIndex.

At each iteration, we examine a temporary substring [str.charAt(headIndex),str.charAt(headIndex+1),..., str.charAt(tailIndex)] and keep a copy of the shortest valid substring we’ve seen so far. Said differently, we keep incrementing tailIndex until the above substring contains every unique character in arr.

If the size of the resulting substring equals to arr.length then we return it since by definition there can’t be a shorter valid substring (otherwise, it’ll be missing 1 or more unique characters from arr).

Once we found a valid substring, we increment headIndex as long the substring remains valid. At every increment we also check if the current valid substring is shorter than the previously kept one. If it is, we update result to be the current substring.

We keep repeating the above steps in a loop until we either reach the end of the input string str or return the shortest valid substring, whichever comes first.

To examine the validity of str substrings we use 2 counters:

uniqueCounter (Integer) - the number of unique characters of arr that our current substring contains.
countMap (Map/Hash Table) - the number of occurrences of each character of arr in our current substring.


Pseudocode:

function getShortestUniqueSubstring(arr, str):
    headIndex = 0
    result = ""
    uniqueCounter = 0
    countMap = new Map()

    # initialize countMap
    for i from 0 to arr.length - 1:
        countMap.setValueOf(arr[i], 0)

    # scan str
    for tailIndex from 0 to str.length - 1:
        # handle the new tail
        tailChar = str.charAt(tailIndex)

        # skip all the characters not in arr
        if (countMap.keyExists(tailChar) == false):
            continue

        tailCount = countMap.getValueOf(tailChar)
        if (tailCount == 0):
            uniqueCounter = uniqueCounter + 1

        countMap.setValueOf(tailChar, tailCount + 1)

        # push head forward
        while (uniqueCounter == arr.length):
            tempLength = tailIndex - headIndex + 1
            if (tempLength == arr.length):
                # return a substring of str from
                # headIndex to tailIndex (inclusive)
                return str.substring(headIndex, tailIndex)

            if (result == "" OR tempLength < result.length):
                # return a substring of str from
                # headIndex to tailIndex (inclusive)
                result = str.substring(headIndex, tailIndex)

            headChar = str.charAt(headIndex)

            if (countMap.keyExists(headChar)):
                headCount = countMap.getValueOf(headChar) - 1
                if (headCount == 0):
                    uniqueCounter = uniqueCounter - 1
                countMap.setValueFor(headChar, headCount)

            headIndex = headIndex + 1

    return result


Time Complexity: we’re doing a linear iteration of both str and arr of lengths N and M respectively, so the runtime complexity is linear in the size of the input, i.e. O(N+M).

Space Complexity: we’re using a Map/Hash Table countMap with M key/values pairs plus few constant size counters, which together give us an O(M) space complexity (linear in the size of arr).
